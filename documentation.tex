\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Addressing Industry Challenges}
The healthcare sector is undergoing a profound transformation driven by the digital revolution and the increasing importance of data-driven decision making. This transformation is reshaping how healthcare facilities operate, manage resources, and deliver services. Modern healthcare institutions generate an unprecedented volume of data that, when properly analyzed, can unlock valuable insights for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing operational efficiency. However, traditional data analysis methods often fall short in capturing the intricate web of relationships between different healthcare entities and services.

The complexity of healthcare data is multifaceted, spanning across various dimensions including clinical services, administrative operations, and facility characteristics. This data originates from diverse healthcare systems and databases, creating a complex network of interconnected information points that conventional analysis tools struggle to process effectively. The challenge is further amplified by the geographic distribution of facilities and the diverse range of medical services they offer, each with its own unique characteristics and requirements.

The current landscape of healthcare data analysis presents several significant challenges. Traditional approaches often treat healthcare facilities as isolated entities, failing to capture the rich network of relationships that exist between them. This limitation becomes particularly evident when trying to understand service dependencies, resource sharing, and operational interdependencies. Furthermore, the static nature of conventional analysis tools makes it difficult to adapt to the dynamic nature of healthcare operations and evolving service requirements.
